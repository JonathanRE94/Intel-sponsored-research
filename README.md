# Enhancing Flip-Chip Reliability with Liquid Gallium Solder Joints

This repository contains Intel-sponsored research work investigating **liquid gallium** as an alternative solder material to SAC305 in flip-chip packaging. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, thermomechanical warpage and stress simulations were conducted over a temperature range of 30°C to 150°C.

# Motivation
Conventional SAC305 solder joints suffer from reliability issues such as cracking under thermomechanical stress. Liquid gallium, modeled as an incompressible fluid, exhibits lower stress and reduced warpage.

# Key Results
- Max Von Mises Stress:** SAC305 = 121 N/mm² vs. Gallium = 71.6 N/mm²  
- Warpage Reduction:** 2.84 × 10⁻⁴ mm with liquid gallium  
- Plastic Strain:** Significantly lower for gallium joints  
- Stress Distribution:** Gallium shows uniform stress and no localized plastic deformation
