Intel-sponsored research project on improving product reliability in advanced semiconductor packaging, by evaluating liquid gallium as a next-gen solder material for flip-chip assemblies.

Achieved a 40.8% reduction in Von Mises stress and 2.84 × 10⁻⁴ mm reduction in warpage through COMSOL Multiphysics-based thermal and warpage simulations, comparing SAC305 with liquid gallium.

Discovered stress redistribution behavior, observing a shift in peak stress from the solder-silicon to the underfill-silicon interface, indicating better mechanical performance under thermal cycling.

Completed the project within 9 weeks while handling full graduate coursework by self-learning COMSOL, researching gallium’s thermophysical properties, and performing fluid-structure modeling.

Used SolidWorks for CAD design and integrated models into COMSOL to simulate chip-scale thermomechanical behavior under realistic loading conditions.

Presented research at ASU’s Fulton Forge Research Expo (Spring 2025) to faculty and industry stakeholders, showcasing reliability improvements in Intel-sponsored packaging designs.

Delivered weekly technical presentations to lab peers and faculty advisor, iteratively refining simulation accuracy based on feedback.
